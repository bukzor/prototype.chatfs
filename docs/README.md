# docs/ - Documentation

This directory contains all project documentation beyond the root-level quick
references.

## Documentation Map

**Start here based on your goal:**

- **New user? Want overview?** → [../README.md] - What the project does
- **Want to contribute?** → [../HACKING.md] - Setup and development workflow
- **Resume development session?** → [../STATUS.md] → Latest [dev/devlog/]
- **Understand design decisions?** → [dev/design-rationale.md] - Why choices were made
- **Learn system architecture?** → [dev/technical-design.md] - How it works
- **Check project roadmap?** → [dev/development-plan.md] - Milestones and tasks
- **Working with LLM assistant?** → [../CLAUDE.md] - Quick reference guide

**Recommended reading flow for new contributors:**
1. [../HACKING.md] - Setup and conventions
2. [dev/design-rationale.md] - Understand why
3. [dev/technical-design.md] - Understand how
4. [../STATUS.md] - See current state

## Structure

- **dev/** - Developer-focused documentation (design, plans, logs)
- (future) **examples/** - Usage examples and tutorials for end users
- top-level namespace reserved for user-facing documentation.

## What Belongs Here

**Detailed documentation** that would clutter the root directory:

- Design rationale and decisions
- Technical specifications
- Development plans and milestones
- Session logs and history
- Usage examples and tutorials
