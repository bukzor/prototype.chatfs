# Layered Architecture - Detailed Analysis

**Status:** TODO - Deep dive to be written if needed

This document would contain:

- Detailed comparison of monolithic vs layered architectures
- Historical examples (Git, Unix tools)
- Performance analysis of IPC overhead between layers
- State management trade-offs across layers
- Testing strategy implications for each layer
- Migration path to capnshell (technical details)
- Rationale for learn-then-abstract approach (M1-CLAUDE before M2-VFS)

See
[../design-rationale.md#layered-architecture-four-layers]
for the decision summary.

**Note:** May not need this level of detail. The summary in design-rationale.md
may be sufficient.
