# docs/dev/design-rationale/ - Decision Deep Dives

Detailed analysis and justification for major architectural decisions.

## What Belongs Here

**Deep-dive rationale documents** that would make design-rationale.md too long:

- Extensive alternatives analysis
- Prototypes and experiments that informed decisions
- Trade-off studies with detailed examples
- Historical context for pivotal choices

Each document should:

- Focus on a single major decision
- Show alternatives considered with pros/cons
- Explain the reasoning process
- Be referenced from design-rationale.md with a brief summary

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- Brief decision explanations (stay in design-rationale.md)
- Implementation details (goes in docs/dev/design/)
- Active design exploration (goes in design-incubators/)

## Guidelines

Create a file here when:

- Decision rationale exceeds ~200 lines
- Multiple approaches were prototyped
- Decision is frequently questioned or referenced
- Historical context is important to preserve

Link from design-rationale.md with a 1-paragraph summary.
