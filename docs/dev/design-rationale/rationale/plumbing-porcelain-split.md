# Plumbing/Porcelain Split - Detailed Analysis

**Status:** TODO - Deep dive to be written if needed

This document would contain:

- Detailed comparison of monolithic vs composable architectures
- Historical examples (Git, Unix tools)
- Performance analysis of IPC overhead
- State management trade-offs
- Testing strategy implications
- Migration path to capnshell (technical details)

See
[../design-rationale.md#plumbing-porcelain-split](../design-rationale.md#plumbing-porcelain-split)
for the decision summary.

**Note:** May not need this level of detail. The summary in design-rationale.md
may be sufficient.
