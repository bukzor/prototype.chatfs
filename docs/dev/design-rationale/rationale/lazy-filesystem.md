# Lazy Filesystem Model - Detailed Analysis

**Status:** TODO - Deep dive to be written if needed

This document would contain:

- Performance benchmarks (eager vs lazy for 10/100/1000/10000 conversations)
- Disk usage analysis
- Implementation complexity comparison
- FUSE technical investigation
- Staleness detection algorithms
- Edge cases and failure modes

See
[../design-rationale.md#lazy-filesystem-model]
for the decision summary.

**Note:** May not need this level of detail. The summary in design-rationale.md
may be sufficient.
