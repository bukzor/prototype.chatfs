# Unofficial API Choice - Detailed Analysis

**Status:** TODO - Deep dive to be written if needed

This document would contain:

- Ecosystem survey of all Claude API options (official, browser extensions,
  unofficial clients)
- Technical analysis of Cloudflare TLS fingerprinting bypass techniques
- Comparison of unofficial-claude-api alternatives (st1vms vs others)
- Risk analysis and mitigation strategies
- Maintenance burden assessment
- Fallback plans if API breaks

See
[../design-rationale.md#unofficial-api-instead-of-official]
for the decision summary.

**Note:** May not need this level of detail. The summary in design-rationale.md
may be sufficient.
