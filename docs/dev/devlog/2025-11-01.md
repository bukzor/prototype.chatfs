# Devlog: 2025-11-01

## Focus

Documentation consistency review and polish. Identified and resolved status contradictions, broken links, and structural inefficiencies before finalizing Milestone 0.

## What Happened

### Completed

- **Recovered from rsync accident**

  - User ran `rsync -Pav template.python-project/ ./` attempting to import baseline config
  - Overwrote several files including pyproject.toml and entire git history
  - Restored files from memory/reconstruction
  - Git history squashed (lost original 3 commits, no significant loss)
  - Outcome: Project recovered, pyproject.toml properly configured for claifs

- **Comprehensive documentation review**

  - Analyzed all 30 documentation files for self-consistency, utility, redundancy, efficacy
  - Identified 7 critical inconsistencies and structural issues
  - Outcome: Clear action plan for resolving documentation gaps

- **Fixed Milestone 0 status contradiction**

  - STATUS.md declared M0 complete but development-plan.md showed in-progress
  - Resolution: Marked M0 as "In Progress" - need to populate placeholder docs before completion
  - Moved yesterday's completions to 2025-10-30.md devlog
  - Outcome: Clear status tracking across documents

- **Documentation structure improvements**
  - Added "Last Updated" dates to all main design docs (done 2025-10-30, documented today)
  - Marked technical-design.md as "soft/under discussion"
  - Clarified api-reference.md as reference doc (populate during M1)
  - Created placeholder files for all referenced-but-missing docs
  - Fixed relative path references (design/ → technical-design/)
  - Removed fork representation duplication from api-reference.md

### Completed (continued)

- Fixed broken link in devlog/2025-10-30.md
- Updated development-plan.md M0 checklist (checked completed items, added review/refine task)
- Added Status fields to M1 and M2 in development-plan.md
- Updated README.md and related docs to use 'aider-ng' codename (replacing "TBD?")
- Updated documentation-howto.md with concise placeholder policy
- Created today's devlog and updated devlog/README.md

- **Refactored STATUS.md and CLAUDE.md**
  - Moved "Current Focus" from CLAUDE.md to STATUS.md (single source of truth)
  - Simplified STATUS.md: removed blow-by-blow details, just references devlog
  - CLAUDE.md now references STATUS.md for current state
  - Outcome: Clear separation - STATUS.md = where we are, CLAUDE.md = how to work

## Decisions Made

### Placeholder Files Policy

**Decision:** Placeholders are acceptable as urgent, next-up action items

**Rationale:**

- Placeholders identify missing documentation that needs to be written
- They serve as explicit TODOs for Milestone 0 completion
- Better than implicit references that readers can't verify exist

**Impact:** Updates documentation-howto.md to clarify when placeholders are appropriate

**Implementation:** Placeholder files must:

- Clearly state "TODO" status and when they'll be populated
- Link back to parent document for context
- Be populated before marking milestone complete

### Related Projects Naming

**Decision:** Codename unnamed AI assistant project "aider-ng"

**Rationale:**

- More concrete than "TBD?"
- Indicates relationship to aider (modular AI coding assistant concept)
- "-ng" suffix indicates "next generation" approach

**Impact:** Updates README.md

### STATUS.md Role Clarification

**Decision:** STATUS.md is single source of truth for "current state", not duplicated in CLAUDE.md

**Rationale:**

- CLAUDE.md was duplicating "Current Focus" section
- STATUS.md designed for "where are we now"
- CLAUDE.md should focus on "how to work on this project"
- Devlog has session details, so STATUS.md doesn't need blow-by-blow

**Implementation:**

- Moved "Current Focus" to STATUS.md
- Simplified STATUS.md to reference devlog for details
- CLAUDE.md now just links to STATUS.md

**Impact:** Clearer separation of concerns, no duplication

### Development Plan as Living Document

**Decision:** Track per-task/feature status in development-plan.md, not STATUS.md

**Rationale:**

- STATUS.md should be high-level snapshot only
- development-plan.md already has milestone structure and deliverables
- Checkboxes in development-plan.md get updated as work progresses
- More scalable - detailed tracking lives with the plan, not duplicated

**Implementation:**

- development-plan.md has checkboxes for all deliverables
- Each milestone has Status field (Not Started/In Progress/Blocked/Complete)
- STATUS.md links to active milestone for detailed progress
- Update checkboxes during session as tasks complete

**Impact:** development-plan.md becomes living document, STATUS.md stays minimal

## Open Questions

1. **Should we populate all placeholder docs before starting M1?**

   - Context: M0 has pending items to flesh out design docs
   - User preference: Firm up design before implementation
   - Decision pending

2. **Should we investigate fork representation via API now or defer?**
   - Context: Fork design is in design-incubator, doesn't block M1 (read-only)
   - Could inform overall design if investigated early
   - Decision pending

## Next Session

**Start here:** Complete remaining M0 tasks (no particular order yet):

1. Fill out the TODO/placeholder documentation

   - api-reference.md
   - caching-strategy.md
   - markdown-format.md
   - porcelain-design.md

2. Solidify technical design and data structures

   - Finalize API client wrapper design
   - Define exact data models (Org, Conversation, Message schemas)
   - Nail down JSONL format specifications

3. Apply template.python-project baseline repo configurations
   - Pre-commit hooks
   - Linting/formatting setup
   - CI configuration (if any)
   - Development tooling

**Then decide:**

- Option A: Investigate fork representation before M1
- Option B: Start M1 implementation (read-only doesn't need forks solved)

**Blockers:** None

## Session 2: Documentation Fixes and Link Cleanup

### Completed

- **Fixed all identified documentation issues**
  - Path references: Changed bin/plumbing → lib/claifs/plumbing with entry points
  - Testing sections: Clarified as post-M0 (removed "not yet configured" ambiguity)
  - M0 deliverables: Added "rough draft" qualifiers (removes circularity)
  - M0 subtasks: Added "delete unnecessary detail placeholder docs"
  - Data flow: Already optimal (README high-level, CLAUDE quick ref, technical-design canonical)
  - Testing duplication: Removed from technical-design.md, links to HACKING.md
  - Cache docs: Consolidated (technical-design detailed, HACKING brief with link)
  - Documentation Map: Added to docs/README.md with persona-based navigation

- **Markdown link cleanup**
  - Fixed 62 redundant link patterns: `[filename.md](path/to/filename.md)` → `[path/to/filename.md]`
  - Cleaner syntax throughout all documentation
  - Applied across 22+ files (root docs, docs/dev/, devlog/, subdirectories, lib/)

### Outcome

Documentation grade improved from **B+** to **A-**:
- Self-consistency: A (no contradictions remain)
- Utility: A- (excellent navigation, minor placeholder debt acknowledged)
- Redundancy: A (proper tiering, consolidated sources)
- Efficacy: A (multi-session continuity achieved)

**To reach A+:** Delete 5-6 "may not need this" placeholder files (optional)
