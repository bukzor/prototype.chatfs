# docs/dev/development-plan/ - Milestone Task Breakdowns

Detailed task breakdowns for individual milestones.

## What Belongs Here

**Per-milestone implementation plans** that would make development-plan.md too
long:

- Task lists with dependencies
- Implementation subtasks and checklists
- Milestone-specific design notes
- Completion criteria details

Each document should:

- Correspond to a milestone in development-plan.md
- Break deliverables into specific tasks
- Track completion status
- Be referenced from development-plan.md

## What Doesn't Belong Here

- High-level milestone overview (stays in development-plan.md)
- Design rationale (goes in docs/dev/design-rationale/)
- Implementation details (goes in docs/dev/technical-design/)

## Guidelines

Create a file here when:

- Milestone has >20 tasks
- Tasks need detailed specifications
- Multiple sessions will focus on one milestone
- Tracking completion status is valuable

Link from development-plan.md with milestone summary.
